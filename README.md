# Company-Landing-Page
I've successfully wrapped up my initial internship task at TechnoHacksEduTechOfficial. 
I designed a dynamic company landing page using a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A standout feature of this project is its responsiveness. I meticulously crafted it to seamlessly adapt to smaller devices and larger screens, 
leveraging media queries for this purpose. This achievement reflects my dedication and technical prowess. 
You can review the project's comprehensive details, including the company name and task name, on my GitHub repository. 
This accomplishment marks the first step in my journey with TechnoHacksEduTechOfficial, and I'm eager to tackle more challenges ahead.
